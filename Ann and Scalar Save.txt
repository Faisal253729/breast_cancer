## **5️⃣ `ann_model.h5` and `scaler.save`**

- These are **binary files**, so you cannot copy their content here.  
- You must **save them from your trained model** as I showed before:

```python
# Save trained model
model.save("ann_model.h5")

# Save scaler
import joblib
joblib.dump(scaler, "scaler.save")
